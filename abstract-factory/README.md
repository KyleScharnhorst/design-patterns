An Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

-Gamma, Erich, et al. “Abstract Factory” Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1995, pp. 87–87.

In this example the furniture factory provides the abstract interface where concrete instances of furniture factories create the objects.

Factory Method and the Singleton design patterns are also featured in this example.

Alternatively rather than creating new objects with a Factory Method we could return Prototypes instead.
